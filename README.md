Under Night Title Editor by Zander3312

To use, place in the same directory as an Under Night save file and run.
You can find your save by going to Steam and right clicking the game's name and going to Manage > Browse local files.
From there, go to Save > {your Steam ID}. SYS-DATA is your save.
Program will output a file called "SYS-DATAoutput". It makes a new file for a reason; make sure it works before deleting your old save!
Rename it to SYS-DATA and replace it in the previously mentioned file path and you'll be done.
Maximum title length is 63 characters. Try to stick to characters you could find on a normal English keyboard.
If you find any bugs let me know. Have fun.
